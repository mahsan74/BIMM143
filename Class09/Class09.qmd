# 1: Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank

To read the file we are going to use command `read.csv:`

```{r}
pdb_stats <- read.csv('Data Export Summary.csv', 
                      row.names=1)
head(pdb_stats)
```

we need to sum all the elements of the X.ray column:

```{r}
(pdb_stats$X.ray)
```

we are going to use `gsub` to remove the commas

```{r}
gsub(',','',pdb_stats$X.ray)
```

```{r}
as.numeric(gsub(',','',pdb_stats$X.ray))

```

We use the sum command to get the sum

```{r}
n_xray <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(',','',pdb_stats$X.ray)))
n_em <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(',','',pdb_stats$EM)))
n_Total <-sum(as.numeric(gsub(',','',pdb_stats$Total)))

```

-   **Q1:** What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

    ```{r}
    p_xray <- (n_xray /n_Total)
    p_em <- (n_em) / n_Total

    p_xray
    p_em
    p_Total = p_xray + p_em
    p_Total
    ```

-   **Q2:** What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

    ```{r}
    total_protein <- as.numeric( gsub(',', '', pdb_stats[1, 7]) )
     total_protein
    ```

    ```{r}
    total_protein/ n_Total
    ```

-   **Q3:** Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB? 2064 stucture

# 2. Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

**Q4**: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure? **to see the structure more clear and get better visualization**

**Q5**: There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have? **HOH 308**

**Q6**: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend *"Ball & Stick"* for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

# 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

```{r}
#install.packages("bio3d")
library(bio3d)
pdb <-  read.pdb("1hsg")
```

```{r}

```

```{r}
pdb
```

**Q7:** How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

198

**Q8:** Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

HOH and KM1

**Q9:** How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2 chains

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure by NMA

for thhis part we are going to read a new PDB structure of Adenylate Kinase and perform Normal mode analysis:

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb('6s36')
```

```{r}
adk
```

with nma or normal mode analysis we can predict protein flexibility and potential functional motions:

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
class(m)
plot(m)
```

To view a "movie" of these predicted motions we generate a molecular "trajectory" with the `mktrj()` function and load it in the Mol\* :

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

Then we were able to generate the animation in Mol\*.
